## Variant


### Q & A


Section: Graphs of Variant for Travel/non-Travel
"You are trying to find five different variants. The first one will be the one which has the largest proportion 
value over the whole data set. The second one will be the one with the next largest proportion value over 
the whole data set (that isn't the first variant) ... imagine plotting the time series for each variant - it's 
the five variants that have the highest points on those graphs."


Is 4.2 numerically possible?  Or, can you explain the question to us?

4.2 Stacked Bars
Plot two stacked bar charts – one for travel-related and one for non-travel related cases – of these five variants,
including a bar for “Other” such that the weekly proportions sum to one again.

Other = 'Other' + 'variants not in top five'
